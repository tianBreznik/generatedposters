Our daughter is 17 and she made a mistake while reversing my husbands car the other day. She put a small dent in the rear bumper. He has a huge temper and he reduced her to tears as soon as he found out. Since then, he hasn’t let her eat a meal. She’s been coming out of her room with tears in her eyes, but he instead makes her sit at the table and watch the rest of us eat, while she isn’t allowed to touch anything. He keeps asking her if she learnt her lesson yet. Each time she keeps crying and saying that she’s sorry, but he just ignores her when she’s begging for food.
Shes on five days since her last meal and she can barely sit up in bed. I have to help her to the bathroom because her legs will just buckle. She tells me that it physically hurts to be so hungry. I hope she isn’t in too much pain because that just makes it more terrible to think about. There’s nothing I can do for her, because he’ll basically use me as a boxing bag if I try. He once hit me hard enough to collapse my lung because I was breathing too heavily next to him in bed. Now I’m just hoping that there’s no effects on her body from going so long without eating? I’m scared that she’ll get sick or her organs will get damaged or something. When I went to talk to her earlier, I could hear her stomach the entire time and from 5 feet away. It sounded really bad and I felt terrible just leaving her like that. She begged me to try and bring her some food but I’m terrified of being beaten up, which is what he’s done to me before. So like a coward, I’m just watching my daughter crying and starving because I’m too much of a weakling to handle a few kicks and punches from him.
