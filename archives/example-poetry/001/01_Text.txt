I am a 25 year old girl married since 2 years. I am married to a man who is now 29 years old. He has a serious aggressive behavior. He physically and verbally abuses in almost all the fights we have. We have had various horrible fights leading me to several severe injuries. He tries to control it and feels sorry as well, but things are just falling apart instead of improving. The only problem is that we love each other. Not sure about his depth, but I am madly in love that I am accepting all his abuses just to be with him and never gave a hint to my family regarding his behavior since these 2 years.
When he gets angry, he hits me so bad. Throws me on the bed, throws me on the floor, chokes my neck, chokes my face, presses me against the wall, spits on my face, slaps me hard on my face and thigh, kicks me, pinches me and what not.
He used to be sorry until now, but since past couple of fights he has started blaming me for everything and keeps on bringing faults in me and creates a scene out of my small mistakes. I am badly hurt that now he has even started abusing me and counting my mistakes in front of his family on such a level that even his family is making that picture of me in their head. Few recent fights have emptied me from inside believing I have no self esteem and worth.
Today I was just surfing through the web and found out that his symptoms completely match with the symptoms of people suffering from "Intermittent explosive disorder". Now, I am very worried as to what is to be done. I can't leave him with this disorder nor can I live with him.
I don't know what to do. Many times I have thought of leaving him, but just the word called "LOVE" doesn't let me do so.
